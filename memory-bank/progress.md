# Progress: Visual Question Answering Pipeline

## 1. What Works

*   The Streamlit application successfully launches and provides a user interface.
*   The application can process single images, batch process folders, and handle image uploads.
*   The system correctly interacts with the local LLaVA model via `ollama`.
*   The evaluation script can parse the model's answers and the ground truth data.

## 2. What's Left to Build

*   The project is functional, but could be extended with more advanced features, such as:
    *   Support for more VQA models.
    *   A more sophisticated evaluation metric.
    *   A database for storing results instead of text files.

## 3. Current Status

The project is in a stable state and can be used for its intended purpose. The initial documentation has been created, and the project is ready for further development or use.
