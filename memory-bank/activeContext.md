# Active Context: Initial Project Analysis

## 1. Current Focus

The current focus is on understanding the existing codebase and preparing the initial project documentation. This involves analyzing the project's components, identifying its core functionalities, and documenting them in the Memory Bank.

## 2. Recent Changes

*   The project has been analyzed to understand its structure and dependencies.
*   The initial Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`) have been created.

## 3. Next Steps

*   Create the remaining initial Memory Bank files (`systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).
*   Propose a project name, summary, README file, and a short project description for GitHub.
